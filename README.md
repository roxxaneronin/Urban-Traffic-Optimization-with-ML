# Urban-Traffic-Optimization-with-ML
This project aims to develop a smart urban traffic management system that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) and YOLO-based vehicle detection to optimize traffic light timings in real-time, reduce congestion, and improve traffic flow.

üìå Project Overview
Simulation Tool: SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)

Vehicle Detection: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

Machine Learning: Reinforcement Learning (PPO using Stable-Baselines3)

Language: Python

Objective: To minimize waiting time, queue length, and maximize vehicle throughput in an urban grid.

üó∫ System Design
Grid: 3x3 SUMO network with traffic signals at key junctions (A1, B0, B1, B2, C1).

Input: Real-time video feed or recorded video (processed using YOLOv8 for vehicle detection).

Control: RL agent adjusts traffic light phases based on live vehicle counts.
